One of the greatest tools of in the statistic's instructor's pocket nowadays is the ability to demonstrate statistical topics through simulation. You can allow students to make guesses about what might happen and let them discover the outcome before their very eyes. Notions of long term probability and convergence suddenly have a meaning they can see for themselves. Below is a compilation of simulations I have used in my various classes with both links to the code and an explanation of the simulation and how it may be used in the classroom.
