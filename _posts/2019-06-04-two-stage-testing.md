:notes: *Summertime, and the living is easy* :notes:

One of the greatest treats of getting to teach summer session, for me, is class sizes that can accommodate a bit of experimenting. Throughout the year I gather many ideas from colleagues, websites, and students about things that could be done in the classroom and I spend the rest of Fall and Winter imagining what it will be like in summer session when I both have the time to dedicate to implementing a new system or practice and I have few enough students that I can course correct if necessary. The last summer course I taught in 2017 I took the time to learn how to use [Crowdmark](http://www.crowdmark.com) and implemented it for all of my quizzes and tests. I fell head over heels with it and now sing the praises of Crowdmark to anyone who will listen (maybe a future blog post?). Apart from the fact that it legitimately is a miracle tool for marking math based assessments for large classes, I do feel strongly that part of my love for it came from the fact that I had the time to do it properly and was already set up for success.

This summer I have the extreme luxury of teaching a section of STAT 1150 to 15 students. The course is our version of introductory statistics aimed at science students and those from mathematically rich disciplines. It is meant to be as much training as introduction and has an R computing component to it that is not present in our STAT 1000 class that is meant as a survey course for those wanting to know a little bit more about statistics or who are seeking a math credit (I whole heartedly approve of statistics for this choice). The students, as whole, in this course tend to have fairly strong math skills and are up to learning and trying new things. Generally speaking, I refer to 50 student classes as very small so this opportunity to try some innovative new ideas with a group that was going to be receptive to is what just too much to pass up on. I spent most of the Winter term listening to those in science education and seeing what they were most excited about and planned what I would do. There were two big takeaways for me, and I will eventually talk about them both, but what has me most excited at the moment is the two-stage testing.

I first learned about two-stage testing from a colleague in the mathematics department who was planning on implementing it in a first-year math course designed for marketing students. The basic premise of a two-stage test is that students would start by writing an individual portion of their test as they normally would and then they would be split in groups and do a portion as a group test where each group submits one paper. I have learned that there are many different philosophies on the implementation but a common approach to the grading is to give students the best mark of either 100% their individual mark or a weighted average of something in the range of 10-20% coming from their group mark and the remaining from their individual mark. The idea behind it being that students should not feel like they might be penalized for the skill level of their group nor should students be able to take large portions of their final marks from the group work.

I found the idea intriguing but it kind of sat in the back of my mind until the winter term when the science teaching and pedagogy working group came together for a meeting and the biology instructors began lobbying hard for the practice. Several of the instructors have implemented them in large scale classrooms and have even conducted them for final exams. What they stressed in our discussion, was that student buy in was very important which was echoed by math colleague. They emphasized that you need to tell the students why you are doing it and that they go as far as handing out citations of scientific literature backing up the testing method. The paper he shared with us was [Collaborative Testing: Evidence of Learning in a Controlled In-Class Study of Undergraduate Students](http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/SEI_research/files/Gilley-Clarkston_2-Stage_Exam_Learning_JCST2014.pdf) which includes suggestions on the implementation of two-stage testing.

When you get down the rabbit hole of reading both peer-reviewed articles and anecdotal pieces on two-stage testing, you will find lots of mixed opinions on what should be on the group portion. Some say the questions should be easier, some say they should be harder. Some say the questions should be identical to the individual, some say similar but not identical and some say completely new. Some say the groups should be randomized, some say they should be assembled by the prof, some say the students should be allowed to make their own groups. The take away from this should be that there is a fair amount of conflicting advice but after some soul searching and looking for what seemed to be the most common ground, I came up with the following for my midterm:

<ul>

    <li> 75 minute individual test, 5 minute break to reorganize, 30 minute group test</li>
    <li> Students were randomly assigned to groups of size 3-4 (using R code that I showed them to demonstrate sampling)</li>
    <li> The individual midterm was no different that any past midterm in the course</li>
    <li> The group test had four questions. Three were either identical to the individual portion or the same with the numbers changed so that they could not just memorize the answers. One question was on a related but not directly covered on the midterm topic that was about a medium difficultly level.</li>
    <li> The mark break down was the best of either: 100% individual or a weighted average of 85% individual and 15% group test.</li>

</ul>

As I said, it was a bit of a "luxury" situation as I had only 14 students writing the test, was in a large room, and the room had tables. I realize that I won't always be so lucky and I am meeting with the biology instructor to find out how they handle large classes, but what I did see going on with the students writing convinced me whole heartedly that it would be worth the effort to figure out how to scale the process.

To my knowledge, none of the students had done a group test before and they have been my most reluctant group yet to work together on iclicker problems so I was fairly nervous as they got into their groups. But it only took them a minute or two to get comfortable and then what I saw absolutely warmed my heart. Students were all working together to solve problems and they were double checking each other's work. While I didn't actually explicitly tell them to make sure everyone understood the solutions, they were all making a conscious effort to teach their group mates what was going on and explain the problems. Groups were laughing and smiling with one another. I saw some of my weaker students listening completely captivated by the classmates trying to understand what was going on. I over heard some of my stronger students make comments like "Oh, I completely forgot about that part on the exam." with genuine enthusiasm that they now knew immediately what they had missed instead of waiting several weeks in suspense. And I swear that my heart grew three sizes to accommodate how wonderful it felt when the first group finished and they all fist bumped one another in celebration of having completed the test as a group effort.

The real revelation of the day, for me, was seeing testing in a completely different way. Testing has always been about assessing students' learning but, for the first time ever, I saw that testing could be a genuine learning experience for the students. All the pro's people had told me ahead of time were absolutely true:

<ul>

  <li> Students received immediate correction on what they did wrong in the individual portion as the questions were largely the same. </li>
  <li> Students saw different approaches to the problems they had just completed.</li>
  <li> The students that struggled more were able to leave the exam on a positive note feeling they had mastered that portion.</li>
  <li> Most of the students, at one point or another, were explaining to their classmates how to do a problem which reinforces their learning.</li>
  <li> Students got to interact with classmates they didn't normally speak to and widened the pool of people they could talk to and ask questions of.</li>
  <li> I had much less I had to review in class because most of the common mistakes were caught in the group portion.</li>

</ul>

In all sincerity, it was probably the most exciting day of my teaching career that I have ever experienced and I spent the whole week gushing to any one that would listen to me. It's a first experience, and it was certainly under ideal conditions, but if replicated true learning happening during testing is something I can accomplish, then I am sold on it. From my one experience so far, if I could offer up one best suggestion to something thinking of trying it, it would be to stick with having questions that were largely right off the actual midterm (with numbers changed as appropriate). For me, the immediate feedback was the biggest selling point. I will be sure to report back when I have tried to scale this to a larger class.
