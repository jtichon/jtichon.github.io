Every year when I teach introductory statistics, and even more so now that I am teaching STAT 1150 with it's inclusion of simulation and computer programming, I feel a little bit at odds with what I am teaching and why I am teaching it. There are a few different things that I feel to be important in a introductory statistics class:
  <ul>
    <li> Teaching numerical/statistical literacy
    <li> Developing an approach of common sense when evaluating statistical claims and sources
    <li> Basic training in methods that can be applied to jobs and courses (both for statistics jobs/courses but in any garden variety job as well)
  </ul>
