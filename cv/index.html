	<h2>Research</h2>

	<div class = cvsubsection>
		<h3>Research interests</h3>

			<p>My academic research interests are in experimental design with a focus on split-plot designs. My areas of research in split-plot designs have covered nonregular, semifoldover, and response surface methodology with categorical factors with a focus on computer algorithms for finding optimal designs.
				I am also actively studying and taking courses and workshops in teaching pedagogy. In particular I am interested in incorporating technology in the classroom, lesson planning, and active learning techniques.
