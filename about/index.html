    I am statistician and university instructor born and raised in Winnipeg. I did an undergraduate Honours BSc in Mathematics and 4-Yr BA in Statistics from the University of Winnipeg. I then moved on to complete my MSc and PhD from the University of Manitoba where I now work as an Instructor. My research area of for my degrees is in split-plot designs, particularly in non-regular designs, semi-folding, and designs with categorical factors. My academic loves are combinatorics and computer programming, so anything that combines the two of them is exactly what I'd like to look into. My pedagogical interests are in incorporating technology and active learning techniques into the classroom.

    When I'm not at work, I can mostly be found at the card table playing competitive duplicate bridge and running several of the weekly bridge games. I enjoy traveling with my bridge partners but also just finding out about card combinations and trying to on the fly estimate bridge odds. My bridge career has certainly influenced me teaching career as I try to incorporate card probability questions into classes where appropriate and hopefully inspire some new young blood in the bridge community.

    Otherwise I can be found making friends with every dog and cat I see, knitting socks, going to the movies, and more recently, going out for a run in the city parks or paths around my house. My motto in life is "Find joy in simple things" and I will gravitate to anything that can hold my attention or bring a little extra sunshine into my life. As we used to joke back in my high school French class, I enjoy running around "apprivoise-ing" things wherever I go.
