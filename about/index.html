    I am instructor at the University of Manitoba in the Department of Statistics, born and raised in Winnipeg. I did an undergraduate Honours BSc in Mathematics and 4-Yr BA in Statistics from the University of Winnipeg. I completed my MSc and PhD from the University of Manitoba under the supervision of Dr. John Brewster. My research area of for my degrees is in split-plot designs, particularly in non-regular designs, semi-folding, and designs with categorical factors. My academic loves are combinatorics and computer programming, so anything that combines the two of them is exactly what I'd like to look into. My pedagogical interests are in incorporating technology and active learning techniques into the classroom, particularly through the use of simulation and data exploration. Most of my recent pedagogical talks have been focused on communicating with students and opening lines of dialogue in low stakes way to help students feel better connected to the class and their instructors.

    At work you can often find me at the Centre for the Advancedment of Teaching and Learning (CATL), taking courses and sharing information with my fellow faculty members. In the Faculty of Science I am a part of Pedagogy and Learning in Science (PALS) working group where we support each other in new techniques in the classroom, host guest speakers, and run a reading group for evidence based teaching techniques. Recently my interests have been in implementing two-stage testing and alternative assessment techniques. My computing interests have been focused on the creation of Shiny apps and Learnr programs to help teach statistical programming in R and demonstrate statistical concepts.

    When I'm not at work, I can mostly be found at the (currently virtual) card table playing competitive duplicate bridge. I enjoy traveling with my bridge partners but also just finding out about card combinations and trying to on the fly estimate bridge odds. My bridge career has certainly influenced me teaching career as I try to incorporate card probability questions into classes where appropriate and hopefully inspire some new young blood in the bridge community. My other love is running on the great trails and pathways in an around the city and province to have some time away from the computer and enjoy the freedom of the outdoors.

    Otherwise I can be found making friends with every dog and cat I see, knitting socks, playing video games, and watching movies. My motto in life is "Find joy in simple things" and I will gravitate to anything that can hold my attention or bring a little extra sunshine into my life. As we used to joke back in my high school French class, I enjoy running around "apprivoise-ing" things wherever I go.
