	<p> Welcome to my website! Things are starting out small at the moment but, as the site grows, you will find resources for teaching statistics, pedagogy related blog posts, videos I have made for demonstrating statistical concepts, talk slides and information about me. </p>

	<p> I am statistics instructor at the University of Manitoba with an interest statistical computing and pedagogy. My teaching shows my love for all things R and R Markdown and giving students the opportunity to explore statistical concepts through simulation and exploration. Feel free to explore my Github repository for projects I am working on. </p>
